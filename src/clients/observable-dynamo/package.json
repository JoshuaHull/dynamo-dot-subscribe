  "description": "A very thin wrapper around the [AWS SDK v3 DynamoDB client](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/tree/main/clients/client-dynamodb) which converts all of their commands to [Observables](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/observable). The API to use this package is identical to that of the original client - but wrapping with rxjs's `from()` is done for you.",
