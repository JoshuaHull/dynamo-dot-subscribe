# Dynamo Dot Subscribe

A collection of packages combining the power of [RXJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview) and [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

## Getting Started

1. > git clone https://github.com/JoshuaHull/dynamo-dot-subscribe
2. > rush update
3. > rush build

## Packages

This is a mono repo built with [Rush](https://rushjs.io/).  
However, you're seeing this repo in its beginnings. So there's only one (notable) package!

[Observable Dynamo DB](https://github.com/JoshuaHull/dynamo-dot-subscribe/tree/main/src/clients/observable-dynamo)

## Running tests
